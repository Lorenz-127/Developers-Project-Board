### User Stories

User Stories were created as GitHub Issues and managed through the project board. Each user story was assigned a priority label using the MoSCoW method:

- Must Have
- Should Have
- Could Have
- High Complexity
- Won't Have (this time)

### Kanban Board
The Kanban board consisted of the following columns:

1. **Backlog**: Open Issues for MoSCoW prioritizing
2. **MVP**: All Issues for pass criteria
3. **ToDo**: User stories for the current sprint
4. **In Progress**: Stories actively being worked on
5. **In Review**: Stories ready for testing
6. **Done**: Completed stories
